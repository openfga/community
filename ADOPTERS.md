| [Procure Ai](https://www.procure.ai/) | ProcureAi uses OpenFGA for user - > roles -> feature permission assignments, as well as fine grained data access permission to check what users can see within our procuretech solution. |
| [Canonical](https://ubuntu.com/) | Canonical is using OpenFGA as the backend permission service for the following internal and open source projects. We have also created an Ubuntu based, security maintained [container](https://github.com/canonical/openfga-rock) and a [Kubernetes operator](https://charmhub.io/openfga-k8s) based on Juju.<br><br>[Juju](https://juju.is/) - open source orchestration engine for software operators that enables the deployment, integration and lifecycle management of applications at any scale, on any infrastructure.<br><br>[Lxd](https://canonical.com/lxd) - open source solution for managing virtual machines and system containers. OpenFGA is used to govern both end user and service accounts permission.<br><br>[Microcloud](https://canonical.com/microcloud) - full stack private cloud solution based on LXD, Ovn and Ceph.<br><br>[Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) - Pro is Canonical's premier enterprise security subscription. OpenFGA is used in the backend services to govern customers entitlements (e.g. access to product support) and simplify self management operations.<br><br>Internal identity platform - self-hosted internal identity provider to govern access to Canonical privileged infrastructure.<br><br>Internal contact service - internal CPQ system to raise and approve customer quotes.<br><br>[Maas](https://maas.io/) (upcoming) - bare metal provisioning system, OpenFGA will be used to govern users, API and “sites” permissions.|

| [ExcID](https://www.excid.io) | ExcID is developing access control solutions for data sharing leveraging OpenFGA. Particularly, multiple instances of OpenFGA are used for storing the relationships among data sources, as well as among data consumers. At the time of access control decision, appropriate relationships are combined. This is achieved using technologies such as W3C Verifiable Credentials and OAuth 2.0 token exchange. ExcID has combined OpenFGA with open-source user management systems and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). |
| [Minder](https://mindersec.github.io/) | [Minder](https://github.com/mindersec/minder/) uses OpenFGA to store hierarchical user->project permissions.  This is also used by [Stacklok](https://stacklok.com/)'s cloud service to store user access. |
